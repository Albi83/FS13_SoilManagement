SoilMod - Change log

============================
Post-version 1.1.x (BETA)

Fixes:

- Front tank for spraying can now be used to spray fertilizer and herbicide.
- If not already set an overlay HUD icon for 'kalk', it will be set by SoilMod.
- Possibility to overwrite the default fruit's relation to fertilizer/herbicide types.

Enhancements:

- Some settings now stored in the CareerSavegame.XML file, so they should be "easier" to change.
  These are; delayGrowthCycle, reduceWindrows, removeSprayMoisture & disableWithering.
  They are found in the <modSoilManagement> section of the careerSavegame.XML file.
- SoilMod will provide default values for the above mentioned settings. However it is also
  possible for map-author to change these. Look for 'setMapProperty' in the supplied
  'SampleModMap - Additions.LUA' script.
  
Additions:

- Plugin support for other mods, so they can "add" their own effects.
  Documentation with examples is yet to be provided. For now, mod-authors/scripters should
  take a look at 'fmcSoilModPlugins.LUA', as SoilMod itself is using its own plugin facility.
- Czech translation by KingFrame & Albi.


============================
Version 1.1.0

Fixes:

- PDA screen 'Fruit Effects' now scrolls, to reveal more crops.
- Overlay HUD icons should now display, particular for 'kalk'. Also when using the zzz_fillTypeOverlays.zip mod.
- A few hardcoded texts moved to ModDesc.XML, so they can be localized.
- Using the localized names for fruits in PDA screens.

Enhancements:

- PDA screen 'Fruit Effects' split up in columns, and should better illustrate what the crops 'likes' and 'dislikes'.
- ModDesc.XML translations for German (by JakobT) and Russian (by Gonimy_Vetrom & VAHA).
- Overlay HUD icons for fertilizer types A,B,C updated by JakobT.
- Prefixed output in LOG.TXT with "SoilMod:".

Additions:

- Instructions for map & script translated to Russian, by Gonimy_Vetrom & VAHA.
- A simple graphical illustration of what to look for in 'SampleModMap - Additions.LUA'.


============================
Version 1.0.0

- Initial public version on FS-UK.COM


============================
Version 0.6.1

- REQUIRED change in SampleModMap.LUA, where call to fmcSoilMod.postInit_loadMapFinished() is moved downwards.

- Bug fixes and tweaks for growth control.


============================
Version 0.6.0

- REQUIRED changes in your map's SampleModMap.LUA script.

  Increased to 5 places where to add calls to fmcSoilMod. Look in the supplied script
  'SampleModMap - Additions.LUA' for what to copy and where.
  
  This was needed, to make sure that the SoilManagement.ZIP mod won't affect any other
  maps which have no support for it.

- Misc. minor changes in the scripts.

- Replaced the lime (kalk) HUD icon, with something differently.

- Updated foliage_weed_diffuse_atlasSize_2.dds.


============================
Version 0.5.x

- Renamed foliage-sub-layers due to avoiding clashing with potential 
  existing foliage-sub-layers in a mod-map. 

  IMPORTANT!

    If you have a map made with v0.4.x, you MUST DO the following in your 
    map.i3d file: Rename the following foliage-sub-layer names for SoilMod, 
    so they are prefixed with "fmc_". 
    
    Example:
                          \/                --rename to-->                     \\//
    <FoliageSubLayer name="manure"                -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_manure"
    <FoliageSubLayer name="slurry"                -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_slurry"
    <FoliageSubLayer name="lime"                  -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_lime"
    <FoliageSubLayer name="weed"                  -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_weed"
    <FoliageSubLayer name="fertilizerOrganic"     -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_fertilizerOrganic"
    <FoliageSubLayer name="fertilizerSynthetic"   -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_fertilizerSynthetic"
    <FoliageSubLayer name="herbicide"             -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_herbicide"
    <FoliageSubLayer name="soil_pH"               -->   <FoliageSubLayer name="fmc_soil_pH"

- Changed requirements in SampleModMap.LUA, so there are now only 3 
  places which needs to be added. 

- Added possibility to set custom fruit-type's correlation for 
  'fertilizer' and 'herbicide' when using SoilMod in "Advanced Mode". 

  This must be set up in the SampleModMap.LUA, as illustrated in the 
  sample script. 
  
  Example:
      fmcSoilMod.setFruit_FertilizerBoost_HerbicideAffected("tomato"       , "fertilizer2"    , "herbicide3")
                                                         -- <Name of fruit>, <fertilizer-type>, <herbicide-type>

- Fixed when a fruit-type does not have a corresponding foliage-sub-
  layer, an error would occur calling getDensityMapFileName() 

- Fixed attempt at loading savegame0/careerSavegame.xml, when only
  being client. 

- Fixed problematic MP event in fmcGrowthControl.LUA being sent/-
  received before client began to run its update() function. 

  
============================
Version 0.4.x

- Initial closed beta test.
